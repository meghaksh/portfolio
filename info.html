							<p>
								I am a Systems Engineer with more than 1.5 years of Industry Experience in India. 
								I am currently working at Infosys Limited in southern Indian cultural capital - Mysore, Karnataka. 
								I am planning to pursue a graduate degree starting from the term fall 2020 with a focus on HCI, Visual Computing, and MultiMedia. 
								Outside of work, I am a solo traveler and I love to connect with people from different places around the world.

								<h4>My journey</h4><br/>I started my career in India as a freelance graphic-designer alongside my full-time undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. While working for FootPrints at MSU, I came in touch with one of the researchers in the field of HCI - Dr Roel Vertegaal. Inspired by his vision and work, I started learning about the tools and techniques used in that domain. I got my first opportunity to work on a production-level project as a student intern for the university. After completing my undergraduate degree, I joined Infosys Limited as a Systems Engineer and moved to cultural heritage city - Mysore, Karnataka in the southern part of India. Here I got an opportunity to work on immersive technologies such as AR / VR / MR and various applications of computer vision and multimedia. </p>

							  <h4>Outside of work</h4><br/>
							  My passion for computers and connection with people bleeds outside my job. 
								I led the team of 150 members to organize a national level technical event in February 2018. 
								I worked as a web developer in TEDxSayajigunj - A Regional TED talk organized in March 2017. 
								I am part of one of the biggest socio spiritual organization Shri BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha having a permanent seat in United Nations. 
								I have volunteered for a Bird Rescue team for consecutive 5 years and worked closely with environmentalists,
								social workers, and veterinary doctors. 
								I have backpacked solo in more than 20 states in India and volunteered to teach kids at two villages Sahpura and Umarava.
